Build an app that allow individuals to interact with their community and help find access to resources. The
app should include the following functionally, but feel free to add additional design or functionality that you
feel would enhance the application. Feel free to leverage the wireframe example in order to complete the
list below. Please note that your app must store, retrieve, and update data from a database.
Users should be able to register accounts and login
Two different types of profiles should exist: Community Members & Community Advocates
A homepage should point users to the various tools within the application, including the map of
resources, adding community members, helping community members, and editing your profile
Users should be able to fill out their profile during signup and be able to edit later to update resource
needs.
Community Advocates should be able to view a list of local members, their needs, and record the actions
they take as they provide resources.
All users should have access to a map of resources based on their location
